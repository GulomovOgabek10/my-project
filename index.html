        <h1 class="h1">IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad)</h1>
   <article class="article">
    <p class="p">This is a math olympiad for schoolchildren. It is the oldest of the international science Olympiads. It was
        held for the first time in 1959 in Romania. Since then, it has been held every year (except for 1980). A team
        consisting of six participants from each country and two team leaders will take part in it.

        Qualifying for the competition varies from country to country, but most often it consists of a series of tests.
        In the International Mathematical Olympiad, approximately 50% of all participants with the highest scores are
        awarded prizes. Teams are not officially recognized and all points are awarded to individual participants only,
        but team results are informally more comparable than individual results. A participant participating in the
        Olympiad must be under 20 years old and not studying at a higher educational institution. Subject to these
        conditions, an individual may participate in the XMO at any time.

        The International Mathematical Olympiad is one of the most prestigious mathematics competitions in the world. In
        January 2011, Google allocated €1 million to the organization of this Olympiad.</p>

    <p class="p">International Olympic Committee (IOC; English: International Olympic Committee
        French: Comité international olympique) is the supreme governing body of the Olympic movement, a non-governmental international sports organization.
        
        History
        In 1894, on the initiative of P. De Coubertin, it was established in order to manage the Olympic Games, to raise the social importance and prestige of these Games, to promote the development of amateur sports and to strengthen friendship between athletes of all countries.
        
        Leadership
        The IOC is a permanent organization that selects its members from among the most active organizers of the sports movement in different countries. The IOC executive committee consists of a president (elected for a term of 8 years), three vice-presidents and 5 members. The Charter of the Olympic Games is a charter document of the IOC. Sessions of the IOC are held annually, twice in the years of the Olympic Games: during the summer and winter games. During the Olympic Games, the IOC grants international sports federations the right to conduct competitions.
        
        Members
        So far, the IOC has recognized more than 200 national Olympic committees (including the National Olympic Committee of Uzbekistan in 1993). The headquarters of the IOC is located in Lausanne (Switzerland).  January 2011, Google allocated €1 million to the organization of this Olympiad.</p>
